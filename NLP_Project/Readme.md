## News Headline Tag Predictor 

- In this project I have created a neural network to predict the tag of a news headline.
- Here I have used 6 TAGS `world`, `tech`, `sports`, `india`, `health`, `entertainment`.
- Model accuracy on `training` data is in range 0.87-0.93
- Model accuracy on `testing`  data is in range 0.85-0.88

- Type `git clone  git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/YOUR-REPOSITORY` 
- press  `Enter` to create a local clone.
- Thats it. 

- Now open the repo in your IDE and run `main.py` file. 
- Thats it. Just wait for some time so model finish training.
- Alternatively, you can also use pre-trained weights stored in `model.h5` file .
